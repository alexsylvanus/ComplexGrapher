# ComplexGrapher
This is a simple application that graphs complex functions.  
Uses calculator format: Does not currently support _2(z+3)_. Must type _2*(z+3)_. Same with 4i, 4.6z, and i(1+i).   
Recognizes constants e, pi, and i.   
   
   
Supported functions:   
__exp(z)   
sin(z)   
cos(z)   
tan(z)   
sinh(z)   
cosh(z)   
tanh(z)   
log(z)   
ln(z)   
sqrt(z)   
abs(z)   
conj(z)__
   
   

Functions to try:   
_**tan(z/3+0.5)*tan(z/2-i+e)/tanh(z/2-3*i+2)   
abs(z)^i/z   
-cos(2/z)**_
